This is a simple Python program that generated time slots and assignments for a baby pool that my friends and I had for another one of my friends.

Basically, a person would say they would be in for X time slots.  Each time slot was a three hour block in the month of December.  (This is all hard coded into the program but could be easily externalized.)  The program then loops through all the buyers and generates X number of unique time slots.  The text output is all of the assignments.

In our pool, our friend ended up delivering on January 1st.  :/
